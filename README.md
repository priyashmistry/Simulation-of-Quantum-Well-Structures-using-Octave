# Simulation-of-Quantum-Well-Structures-using-Octave
A Quantum Well is essentially a potential well that has discrete energy levels. Quantum Wells are double heterostructures i.e. when two semiconductor materials are grown simultaneously into a sandwich. One very famous example of a double heterostructure that is an excellent example for the study of Quantum Well Structures is AlGaAs - GaAs. For purpose of this project, we shall stick to data of this structure for purpose of understanding the theory and logic of these programs. However, the program is designed keeping in mind all the basic physics of quantum well structures.

go through report.pdf once to know more about the usage of the code.
